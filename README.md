# How To Use Smite Mixer Code Redeemer
### 1) Download the latest release [HERE.](https://github.com/Lumbridge/SmiteMixerCodeRedeemer/releases/download/v1.0.6/Smite.Mixer.Code.Redeemer.zip)
### 2) Open the SMITE PC Game client.
### 3) Setup your video settings as they are in the image below.

### 4) Setup the whitelist so you don't get any fake codes from random people, put these names in the whitelist box if they aren't there already:
<code>Scottybot</code>  
<code>HiRezAuvey</code>  
<code>HiRezHinduman</code>  
<code>HiRezFinch</code>  
<code>HiRezVinny</code>  
<code>HiRezTaco</code>  
<code>HiRezRude</code>  
<code>LeTigress</code>  
<code>Fdt</code>  
<code>PeccYz</code>  
<code>Aggro</code>

### 5) Setup notification options if you want notifications, there are 3 options here: You can have a visual notification which pops up a window when a code becomes active OR you can have a sound effect alert you when a new code becomes active (or you can enable both).

### 6) Setup code grab criteria (as of writing this codes start with the letters AP and are 17 characters long) which can be seen below:

### 7) Redeem Codes Semi-Automatically: When codes come into the active codes box you can use the Redeem buttons to have the program redeem the codes for you. (It will bring SMITE to the foreground and type /claimpromotion "promotion code" into the chat).

### 8) Once you have setup the program using the previous steps you can tick the AFK Mode box which will redeem codes as they come in automatically (MAKE SURE SMITE IS KEPT RUNNING AT ALL TIMES, IT CAN BE MINIMISED AND STILL FUNCTION!).
