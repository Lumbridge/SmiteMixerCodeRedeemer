# SmiteMixerCodeRedeemer
This application will monitor the smite mixer chat for chest codes and redeem them using the PC game client.  
  
## Usage
1) Launch Smite in Windowed mode at 1920x1080 resolution (not tested on other resolutions but could work),  
2) Launch SmiteMixerCodeRedeemer.exe, it will connect to the Smite Mixer chat channel and listen for codes,  
3) If it finds a code it will bring the Smite window to the front and attempt to redeem the code using Dolphin Script automation.
