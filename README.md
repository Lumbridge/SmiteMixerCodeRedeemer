### 5) Setup notification options if you want notifications, there are 3 options here: You can have a visual notification which pops up a window when a code becomes active OR you can have a sound effect alert you when a new code becomes active (or you can enable both).

### 8) Redeem Codes Semi-Automatically: When codes come into the active codes box you can use the Redeem buttons to have the program redeem the codes for you. (It will bring SMITE to the foreground and type /claimpromotion "promotion code" into the chat).
