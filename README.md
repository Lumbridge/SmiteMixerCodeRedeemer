# SmiteMixerCodeRedeemer
This application will monitor the smite mixer chat for chest codes and redeem them using the PC game client.  
  
## Usage
1) Launch Smite in windowed mode & change the resolution to 1920x1080,
2) Run the code grabber, active codes will appear in the listbox,  
3a) If AFK mode is activated, the app will automatically take codes from the active codes box and attempt to redeem them.  
3b) If AFK mode is not activated you can use the buttons below the active codes box to make the app redeem the selected code/entire code list.
